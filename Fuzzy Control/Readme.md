# Fuzzy Robot Arm

**Terminology** | **Description**
-----|------------
**Forward Kinematics** | The process of determining the desired Cartesian Co-ordinates from Joint Params. | 
**Inverse Kinematics** | The process of determining the angles of the joints given the desired location of the end effector. | 
**FIS** | Fuzzy Inference System deduces the Inverse Kinematics given the Forward Kinematics of the problem.|
**ANFIS** | Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System is a hybrid technique that brings together Neural Networks and Fuzzy Inference System. |
**Input Data** | Refers to the coordinates dataset.|
**Output Data** | Refers to the angles dataset.|
