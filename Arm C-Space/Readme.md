# Robot-Arm-Configuration-Space
C-space of a 2-link planar robot arm in the presence of two rectangular obstacles is visualized using the cv2 library. The two marked points are the start and goal point and the path between them is obtained via arbitrarily chosen. In the file named as 'animated.py' you can find an animation if the robot arm moving between the start and goal points along the chosen path.

## Changes to be made

  1. Currently, the animation only runs for a pre-defined path. Take input from C-Space, find a path and automate the pipeline.
  2. Add Active-SLAM to it.
