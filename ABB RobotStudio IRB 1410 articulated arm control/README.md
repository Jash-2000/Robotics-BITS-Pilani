This file contains my final project wherein I simulated a commercial 6-DOF robotic articulated arm in a real world simulater called ABB RobotStudio.
The simulation environment keeps into account the workspace constranits and the motor/actuator constrainsts as well.

For the project, I carved my initials i.e. letter J and A onto a vertical wall. The hand processing was done using the following image :

TeachPendant controller was programmed using the RAPID programmer and this was used to collectively demonstrate the inverse kinematics of the 6 DOF arm.

A typical controller looks like this :

For running the code, download the zip file, extract it and open the main station in RobotStudio.
