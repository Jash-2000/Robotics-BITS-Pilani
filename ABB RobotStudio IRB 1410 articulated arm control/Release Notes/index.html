<p>¹ RobotStudio will not benefit from the
additional features of so-called ‘Professional’ or ‘Workstation’ graphics cards. The price level
of these are at a much higher range than gaming graphics cards with comparable
performance. High-end gaming PCs are very suitable for offline programming with
RobotStudio. Such a PC will provide good performance for a limited budget.</p>

<h2 id="known-limitations">Known Limitations</h2>
<h3 id="visual-safemove">Visual SafeMove</h3>
<h4 id="current-joint-values-cannot-be-retrieved-when-external-axes-are-included-in-the-configuration">Current joint values cannot be retrieved when external axes are included in the configuration</h4>
<p>It is not possible to retrieve the current joint values using the Read current values function
on the Synchronization node when external axes are included in the configuration.
Workaround: Read the values from the FlexPendant and update manually.</p>
<h4 id="the-safety-controller-is-not-forwards-compatible">The safety controller is not forwards compatible</h4>
<p>When writing a safety configuration file of a later version than the current safety controller
image, then RobotStudio will generate an error of type “C00FFFE: Unknown error
(0xC004FFFE)LoadSafetyConfigurationFile”. (Note that this error may occur for other
reasons as well and is thus not unique to this case).</p>
<h4 id="the-function-get-vectors-from-active-tool-reads-values-from-the-robot">The function Get vectors from active tool reads values from the robot</h4>
<p>The idea behind this function is to to read the data from the currently active tool of the robot
in order to define a corresponding SafeMove Tool in the safety configuration. That is the
reason why the tool information is read from the robot and not the safety controller. The
tools of the safety configuration are visible the Visual SafeMove itself and does not need a
special function to be retrieved.</p>
<h4 id="protected-checksum-may-change-when-upgrading-rw-from-6040x-to-605-or-606">Protected checksum may change when upgrading RW from 6.04.0x to 6.05 or 6.06</h4>
<p>The protected checksum will change if the input and output modules of the internal device is
protected. The reason is that two attributes change order.</p>
<h4 id="no-visualization-of-safe-range-for-external-axes-in-visual-safemove-for-safemove-basic-or-pro">No visualization of Safe Range for external axes in Visual SafeMove for SafeMove Basic or Pro</h4>
<p>When Safe Range is used to limit the axis range of an external axis such as a track motion,
there will be no visual indication of the actual range in the graphic view.</p>
<h4 id="visual-safemove-windows-can-be-re-opened-from-the-quick-access-toolbar-menu">Visual SafeMove windows can be re-opened from the Quick Access Toolbar menu</h4>
<p>Any windows that are closed can be re-opened using the Quick Access Toolbar menu, as
the command Default Layout does not recover these windows.</p>
<h4 id="safemove-tool-zone-visualization-in-online-monitor-for-robots-with-external-axes">SafeMove Tool Zone visualization in Online Monitor for robots with external axes</h4>
<p>Only TCP robots and track mounted robots will be visualized in the Online Monitor, no other
external axes or positioners.
As a consequence, the Online Monitor may show the robot in a non-violating position, even
though the safety controller has detected a safety violation and stopped the robot.</p>
<h3 id="io-configurator-6">IO Configurator 6</h3>
<h4 id="safety-configuration-problem-with-profisafe-controller-or-cip-safety-scanner">*Safety configuration problem with PROFIsafe Controller or CIP-Safety scanner</h4>
<p>Changing safety settings in Visual SafeMove or IO Configurator 6 does not always work
in conjunction with the &quot;PROFISafe controller&quot; or &quot;CIP-Safety Scanner&quot; option.
Connection with robot controller can be lost during any IO-configuration, sometimes resulting in that the Flex Pendant reboots. Again this is only applicable when the
PROFISafe controller or CIP-Safety scanner option is present in the system.
Problem is dependent on how many devices are configured on respective industrial
network. I.e. EtherNet/IP or ProfiNet.</p>
<h3 id="online">Online</h3>
<h4 id="individual-rapid-tasks-cannot-be-stopped-for-robotware-560-and-later">Individual RAPID tasks cannot be stopped for RobotWare 5.60 and later</h4>
<p>When running multitasking systems, it is not possible to start and stop individual tasks with
the dropdown menu of the task node in the Controller browser. This is due a restriction
introduced with RobotWare 5.60 and later.</p>
<h4 id="individual-rapid-tasks-cannot-be-stopped-for-robotware-560-and-later-1">Individual RAPID tasks cannot be stopped for RobotWare 5.60 and later</h4>
<p>When running multitasking systems, it is not possible to start and stop individual tasks with
the dropdown menu of the task node in the Controller browser. This is due a restriction
introduced with RobotWare 5.60 and later.
However, from RobotWare 6.03 onwards, then RAPID tasks to execute or to stop can be
selected from RobotStudio RAPID tab.</p>
<h4 id="flexpendant-viewer-running-with-automatic-reloading">FlexPendant Viewer running with automatic reloading</h4>
<p>When having FlexPendant Viewer running with automatic reloading of the screens and at
the same time jogging the robot with the joystick the robot jogging might halt when the
FlexPendant Viewer reloads.</p>
<h3 id="online--paint">Online – Paint</h3>
<h4 id="backup-for-paint-systems-does-not-create-backup-of-the-pib-for-irc5p-with-robotware-5xx">Backup for Paint systems does not create backup of the PIB for IRC5P with RobotWare 5.xx</h4>
<p>The Backup function of RobotStudio does not create a backup of the PIB board of the
IRC5P system when running RobotWare 5.xx.
Workaround: Create the backup of the PIB board with the FlexPaint Pendant using an
USB-stick.</p>
<h4 id="go-offline-does-not-work-for-paint-systems">Go Offline does not work for Paint systems</h4>
<p>The Go offline function will not create a working Virtual controller system for Paint system
unless the Paint package I/O option is set to Simulated.</p>
<h3 id="online--integrated-vision">Online – Integrated Vision</h3>
<h4 id="installation-error-when-having-previous-versions-of-robotstudio-or-insight-explorer">Installation error when having previous versions of RobotStudio or Insight Explorer</h4>
<p>If you have a previous version of RobotStudio or Cognex In-Sight software installed,
installing a new version of RobotStudio may result in the following error message</p>
<p><em>Module C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Cognex\InSight\5.7.1674.0\CvsInSightDisplay.ocx failed to register. HRESULT -2147220472. Contact your support personnel.</em></p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> To correct the issue, open Windows Settings -&gt; Apps -&gt; Apps &amp; features,
select the current ABB RobotStudio 2019.x, select Modify, and step through the installation
wizard and select Repair. Alternatively, uninstall and reinstall RobotStudio.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only one version of the In-Sight Display Control can be registered at a time, and this
is always the latest version installed. Although older versions of RobotStudio or In-Sight may
seem to function with this version installed, their compatibility with this version is not
guaranteed.</p>
<h4 id="robotstudio-may-hang-for-up-to-60-seconds-when-configuring-jobs-with-patmax-1-50">RobotStudio may hang for up to 60 seconds when configuring jobs with PatMax 1-50</h4>
<p>The user interface of RobotStudio may freeze for up to 60 seconds when configuration
Integrated Vision jobs with the tool PatMax 1-50.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Use PatMax 1-10 instead</p>
<h4 id="remaining-error--new-emulators">Remaining error – New Emulators</h4>
<p>New camera models have been added to the camera emulator option in RobotStudio
6.04.01. Some of these new models are not yet fully compatible. Our recommendation is to
choose a camera model from the 7000 series which is fully compatible with Firmware
version 4.10.2.</p>
<h4 id="emulated-cameras-not-discovered-when-controller-in-motors-on">Emulated cameras not discovered when controller in Motors On</h4>
<p>For RobotWare 5.61 onwards, the camera discovery mechanism is disabled when the
controller is in Motors On. As a consequence, the camera nodes will not appear in the
controller browser.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Switch to Manual Reduced Speed and use the Refresh command on the
Integrated Vision node in the browser to make the cameras appear.</p>
<h4 id="information--camera-firmware-version-and-update">Information – Camera firmware version and update</h4>
<p>The minimum firmware version to be used with Integrated Vision is 4.08. If this version is not
available for a specific camera model, then the newest version available shall be used.
There are two important things to know before upgrading a sensor:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user must make sure to first backup the files on the camera. This can be done
using the Rapid snippets for camera backup/restore, or the FlexPendant Explorer.</li>
<li>The latest available firmware version may vary across sensor types. However, when
the firmware update utility presents the latest available version it shows the
firmware with the highest version number which may not apply to the sensor to be
updated. However, the appropriate firmware will be applied.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="information--the-spreadsheet-view">Information – The spreadsheet view</h4>
<p>The spreadsheet view is not enabled when editing in the in the following modes “Add part
location tool”, “Add part inspection tool”. Before entering the spreadsheet mode click for
example “Setup Image” or Output to Rapid.</p>
<h4 id="information--calibration-board-without-fiducial">Information – Calibration board without fiducial</h4>
<p>When using the calibration boards, checkerboard or board with dots, the user must select
the preferred origin by clicking and accepting (press enter) three points on the board. Only
after these three points have been selected it is possible to click &quot;calibrate&quot; to execute
the calibration.</p>
<h4 id="information---use-default-camera-settings">Information - Use default camera settings</h4>
<p>If the camera is not using default communication settings the result may be that RAPID
instructions return error code “Communication Error”. The safest method to get default
settings is to go to Connect-&gt;Add Sensor Right click and select “Show all sensors”.
Select the device to reset and click “Apply factory settings” in the lower right corner. The most
important settings are:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-plaintext">Telnet port: 23
User: &quot;admin&quot;
Password: &quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="information--user-credentials">Information – User Credentials</h4>
<p>It is now possible to create user profiles with different access levels on the camera. For detailed information about this, please refer to the Integrated Vision User Manual.</p>
<h4 id="remaining-error--save-image-on-camera">Remaining error – Save image on camera</h4>
<p>It is not possible to save an image on the camera using “Save Image”. This is by design, but
the dialog still allows the user to try to do this. The result is that the image is not saved and
no error message is given.</p>
<h4 id="remaining-error---connect-button-greyed-out-for-no-reason">Remaining error - Connect button greyed out for no reason</h4>
<p>It may sometimes happen that the “Connect” button is greyed out, with the tooltip saying the
camera is not on the correct subnet although the IP settings are OK.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Restart the Integrated Vision Add-In</p>
<h4 id="remaining-error--vc-started-from-controller-add-controller-does-not-detect-cameras">Remaining error – VC started from Controller-&gt;Add controller does not detect cameras</h4>
<p>A VC that is started from Controller-&gt;Add controller does not detect cameras on the
network, even if the VC_network_definition.xml is correctly configured and the firewall is
turned off. The reason is that the controller is not able to detect new cameras on the
network when it is in “Motors On” state. When the VC is started stand-alone in RobotStudio
it is automatically set to “Motors On“ when started.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> To allow it to discover cameras, turn the control panel key to manual mode or
launch the VC as part of a station.</p>
<h4 id="user-tip---removing-cameras-from-configuration">User tip - Removing cameras from configuration</h4>
<p>To remove a configured camera from the list of configured cameras, use the configuration
editor. Enter Configuration-&gt;Communication-&gt;Application Protocols and remove the desired
camera. Perform a warm start to complete the operation.</p>
<h4 id="user-tip--viewing-all-cameras-present-on-the-network">User tip – Viewing all cameras present on the network</h4>
<p>Connect-&gt;Add Sensor is normally used for setting the IP addresses of sensors that are not
currently on the correct subnet (192.168.125.X). Since the dialog shows all cameras “seen”
by the PC, this dialog is useful when error tracing camera network problems.
If a camera does not appear on the network using the “Add sensor” dialog as suggested
above, it is advisable to cycle the power of the camera. If the camera receives power from
the controller, then cycle power by turning the mains switch.</p>
<h4 id="user-tip--warm-start-the-controller-after-changing-network-settings">User tip – Warm start the controller after changing network settings</h4>
<p>Whenever changing the network settings of the camera, either from Connect-&gt;Add Sensor
or Connect-&gt;Network settings, it is important to warm start the controller. If this is not done,
RAPID instructions will give the error “Communication Error” and the FTP-mounted camera
disk is not accessible. If DHCP address is used and persist, please try a static address
instead.</p>
<h3 id="offline">Offline</h3>
<h4 id="issue-with-collission-avoidance-for-palletizer-robots">*Issue with collission avoidance for palletizer robots</h4>
<p>When configuring collision avoidance for a palletizer robot using RobotWare 6.11, attaching an object to a mechanism link can result in an error and the configuration will not be loaded.</p>
<h4 id="the-yumi-library-revision-1-cannot-be-successfully-updated-to-yumi-revision-2">*The YuMi library revision 1 cannot be successfully updated to YuMi revision 2</h4>
<p>When opening a Pack&amp;Go file with a station that has a reference to
<code>IRB14000_0.5_0.5__01.rslib</code> you get the option to update it to the newer
<code>IRB14000_0.5_0.5__02.rslib</code>.</p>
<p>The following issues occurs if you select ‘Yes’ and update the model:</p>
<ul>
<li>The attached parts, for example Smart Grippers, are detached.</li>
<li>The new YuMi robot is not connected to the virtual Controller.</li>
<li>The old YuMi mecanism is converted to a component.</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer ‘No’ to this question to keep the original revision 1 model and avoid the problems
mentioned above.</p>
<h4 id="robotstudio-needs-to-be-restarted-to-update-a-modified-library-instance">RobotStudio needs to be restarted to update a modified library instance</h4>
<p>When editing a library file (.rslib) that is used in a currently open station, then RobotStudio
needs to be restarted to update the library. Simply re-opening the station is not enough to
update the content of the station. Unless RobotStudio is restarted, the old library instance
will remain in memory and be loaded even though the underlying file has been updated.
This is a known limitation and is expensive to fix. There is a workaround to the problem,
which is to restart RobotStudio.</p>
<h4 id="the-robot-irb-1600id-155-m--6kg-replaced-by-irb-1660id155-m--6-kg-in-robotware-604">The robot IRB 1600ID 1.55 m / 6kg replaced by IRB 1660ID1.55 m / 6 kg in RobotWare 6.04</h4>
<p>The robot IRB 1600ID 1.55 m / 6 kg is not available in RobotWare 6.04 and later. It has
been renamed to IRB 1660ID 1.55 m / 6 kg. Virtual controller systems for IRB 1600ID 1.55
m / 6 kg based on RobotWare 6.03 cannot upgraded to RobotWare 6.04 and later. This
means that Pack&amp;Go files for this robot based on RobotWare 6.03 cannot be upgraded to
RobotWare 6.04 automatically</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Re-build or modify the virtual controller system to use IRB 1660ID 1.55 m / 6
kg instead when using RobotWare 6.04 or later.</p>
<h4 id="flexpendant-and-rapid-applications-run-with-logged-in-user-rightsa-flexpendant-or-rapid-application-running-on-the-virtual-controller-runs-with-the-rights-of">FlexPendant and RAPID applications run with logged in user rights<br><br>A FlexPendant or RAPID application running on the virtual controller runs with the rights of</h4>
<p>the logged-in Windows user. RAPID applications running in a background task will start to
execute when the Pack&amp;Go file is opened and FlexPendant applications will start to execute
when the user starts the Virtual FlexPendant.
A warning message has been added to the Unpack&amp;Work wizard to make the user aware
that only Pack&amp;Go files (.rspag) from trusted sources shall be opened.</p>
<p><img src="images/KL-FlexPendant%20and%20RAPID.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="compatibility-of-robotstudio-library-and-stations-with-older-robotstudio-versions">Compatibility of RobotStudio Library and Stations with older RobotStudio versions</h4>
<p>RobotStudio is generally not forwards compatible, i.e. it is not possible to load stations or
libraries created in RobotStudio 6.04 into an earlier version of RobotStudio such as e.g.
RobotStudio 5.x, 6.03.02 or earlier. However, RobotStudio is backwards compatible,
which means stations and libraries created in versions 5.x, 6.03.02 or earlier can be opened
in RobotStudio 6.04</p>
<h4 id="truemove-path-visualization-fails-for-customized-zone-data">TrueMove path visualization fails for customized zone data</h4>
<p>The TrueMove path visualization function only supports predefined zonedata. It will not work
for user defined zonedata.</p>
<h4 id="backup-fails-for-robotstudio-solutions-with-safemove-or-electronic-position-switches">Backup fails for RobotStudio solutions with SafeMove or Electronic Position Switches</h4>
<p>Backups are automatically created for virtual controller systems that are part of a
RobotStudio solution when saving the station. For virtual controller systems with the
RobotWare options SafeMove or Electronic Positioning Switches the backup will fail since
these systems contain files that are read-only. As a result, an error message is presented in
the output window: <code>&lt;System name&gt;: Backup failed</code>. The station will be successfully saved
but there will be no backup created.
Workaround: Ignore the error message <code>&lt;System name&gt;: Backup failed</code> and create a
manual backup whenever needed. The RobotStudio Option “Enable automatic backup of
controllers in solution” that is available in ”RobotStudio Options -&gt; Robotics -&gt; Virtual
Controller” can be de-selected to disable the backup function.</p>
<h4 id="irb-14000-cannot-be-combined-with-any-other-robot">IRB 14000 cannot be combined with any other robot</h4>
<p>The function system from layout fails if trying to create a MultiMove system where one robot
is an IRB 14000. The reason is that the IRB 14000 cannot be combined with any other
robot.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Create a separate system for the IRB 14000.</p>
<h4 id="the-work-envelope-function-does-not-support-irb-14000">The Work Envelope function does not support IRB 14000</h4>
<p>The function is disabled for the IRB 14000 and cannot be activated.</p>
<h4 id="the-2d-work-envelope-fails-for-certain-robot-models">The 2D work envelope fails for certain robot models</h4>
<p>As a result, the generated work envelop may appear distorted.</p>
<h4 id="update-of-current-selection-in-the-3d-graphics-window-may-be-delayed">Update of current selection in the 3D graphics window may be delayed</h4>
<p>A problem related to the graphics driver has been observed on certain PCs. The problem is
that the update of the current selection in the 3D graphics is delayed until the next redraw.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Add or uncomment the following line in the file RobotStudio.exe.config</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;add key=”DoublePresentWorkaround” value=”true” /&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="failure-to-open-packgo-file-to-same-folder-the-second-time">Failure to open Pack&amp;Go file to same folder the second time</h4>
<p>RobotStudio will prevent Pack&amp;Go files to be opened to the same folder a second time if the
station contains VC systems with the EPS or SafeMove option. This is by design to prevent
the safety controller configuration file to be accidentally overwritten.<br></p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Remove the write protection manually using Windows Explorer.</p>
<h4 id="updates-of-instruction-template-and-code-snippets">Updates of instruction template and code snippets</h4>
<p>RobotStudio will not automatically update the user files for instruction templates and code

<h4 id="io-signals-configured-with-access-level-default">I/O signals configured with access level 'DEFAULT'</h4>
<p>When IO signals are configured with access level 'DEFAULT', only input signals are
possible to set/reset from the I/O Simulator and I/O Window. To be able to affect also output
signals, set the access level to ‘ALL’ for them in the Configuration Editor.</p>
<h4 id="vc-does-not-start-with-rri-option-and-gsi-folder-structure-missing">VC does not start with RRI option and GSI folder structure missing</h4>
<p>The VC will hang when started with a system containing the RobotWare option RRI (Robot
Reference Interface) if the GSI folder structure is missing.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Create GSI Folder before starting the VC inside the <em>HOME</em> directory of the
system. See the Application Manual for Robot Reference interface for more information.</p>
<h4 id="system-in-guard-stop-state-in-automatic-mode-after-run-time-error">System in Guard Stop state in Automatic mode after run-time error</h4>
<p>Certain run-time errors may cause the controller system to enter Guard Stop state in
Automatic mode. This is the same behavior as in a physical robot controller system. This
typically happens when a run-time error related to Conveyor Tracking occurs. A simulation
cannot be started when the controller is in this state.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> To reset the controller state, open the Control Panel window and first switch
to Manual mode, and then back to Automatic mode.</p>
<h4 id="path-handling-of-instructions-with-multiple-joint-targets">Path handling of instructions with multiple joint targets</h4>
<p>The path functions Rotate, Translate, and Mirror do not work as expected with instructions
containing via points as jointtargets. The functions will leave the jointtargets as is.
Interpolate Path gives an Unknown Error and Tool Compensation reports an error message.</p>
<h4 id="event-manager-simulation-cannot-be-triggered-by-analog-system-signals">Event Manager: Simulation cannot be triggered by analog system signals</h4>
<p>The event manager only supports analog station signals, not analog system signals.</p>

<h4 id="conveyor-objects-must-be-re-added-for-stations-created-prior-to-rs-605">*Conveyor objects must be re-added for stations created prior to RS 6.05</h4>
<p>When opening stations with conveyor tracking created prior to RobotStudio 6.05, conveyor
objects must be re-added.</p>
<h4 id="incorrect-default-values-for-c1position-and-c1speed-for-robotware-5-with-the-paintware-option">Incorrect default values for c1Position and c1Speed for RobotWare 5 with the PaintWare option</h4>
<p>The default values for the parameters c1Position and c1Speed may become incorrect for a
virtual controller system. The symptom is that its attribute values are all zero, see snapshot
below.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Save the following lines to a CFG file named ‘TEMP.CFG’ or similar and load
in the virtual controller followed by a restart.</p>
<pre><code>EIO:CFG_1.0:5:0::

<h4 id="multimove-error-object-reference-not-set-to-an-instance-of-an-object">MultiMove error: ‘Object reference not set to an instance of an object’</h4>
<p>When the Test Play button is pressed in the MultiMove tool, the following error message
may be displayed: ‘Object reference not set to an instance of an object’, but the robot moves
and the Status ‘Calculation OK’ is displayed. In addition, when ‘Create Paths‘ is pressed the
following message is displayed: ‘Can't create paths : Value cannot be null’, and no paths are
created. In the ‘Create Paths Settings’, is the WP TCP drop down empty.<br></p>
<p><strong>Reason:</strong> Workobject is not set for the current task.</p>

<h4 id="error-50091-restart-not-possible-after-warm-start-of-a-system-with-external-axis">Error 50091: ‘Restart not possible’ after warm start of a system with external axis</h4>
<p>When restarting a system with activated mechanical units the activation state is lost. Then
the program can no longer be started from the Virtual FlexPendant, the RAPID Editor or the
RAPID Tasks window.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Reset the program pointer (‘Program Pointer to Main’) before starting the
program from the Virtual FlexPendant, the RAPID Editor or the RAPID Tasks window, or,
start the program from the Simulation Play button.</p>
<h3 id="network-drives-and-unc-paths">Network Drives and UNC Paths</h3>
<h4 id="robotstudio-on-computers-with-roaming-user-profiles">RobotStudio on computers with roaming user profiles</h4>
<p>RobotStudio may fail on PC configurations with roaming user profiles, i.e. when the users’
documents folder resides on a server and not on the local disk.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Redefine the ’User Project Folder’ to a folder on the local disk (File →
Options → General → Files&amp;Folders → User Project Folder).</p>
<h4 id="virtual-controller-does-not-support-unc-paths">Virtual Controller does not support UNC paths</h4>
<p>UNC paths cannot be used to locate Virtual Controller systems. Using UNC paths for VC
systems will cause the log message ‘Failed to initialize FW upgrade framework’ to appear
when the system starts. Subsequent attempts to work with the VC such as synchronizing
RAPID data will fail.</p>
<h4 id="creating-and-starting-systems-located-on-a-network-drive">Creating and starting systems located on a network drive</h4>
<p>When using a network drive to store RobotStudio data such as RobotWare systems or the
RobotWare mediapool, the following problems may occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual controller does not start</li>
<li>Not possible to open Virtual FlexPendant</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause:</strong> By default, the .NET Framework does not allow execution of code from a remote
file system. This means the application may behave unexpectedly if the media used by the
system or the system itself resides on a network share.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> To resolve this, the user must explicitly grant the required permissions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open the file <em>Virtual FlexPendant.exe.config</em> located in <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\ABB Industrial IT\Robotics IT\RobotStudio 5.61\Bin</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Add the following lines:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
        &lt;supportedRuntime version=&quot;v4.0&quot; sku=&quot;.NETFramework,Version=v4.0&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/startup&gt;

    &lt;/runtime&gt; &lt;!-- THIS IS ONE OF THE NEW LINES!!! --&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Virtual FlexPendant must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

<h4 id="robtargets-that-are-local-to-a-procedure-cannot-be-synchronized-with-robotstudio">Robtargets that are LOCAL to a PROCEDURE cannot be synchronized with RobotStudio</h4>
<p>The RobotStudio synchronization engine that translates 3D data of the station to RAPID
code and vice versa does not support robtargets that are declared locally to a procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Declare the robtargets as global or local to a module instead.</p>
<h4 id="robtarget-names-must-be-unique-in-rapid-even-if-they-are-local">Robtarget names must be unique in RAPID even if they are LOCAL</h4>
<p>RobotStudio requires that robtarget names are unique for the RAPID synchronization to
work properly, i.e. you cannot have a global robtarget named pMyTarget1 in module A and
a local robtarget with the same name in Module B.</p>
<h4 id="global-robtargets-cannot-be-made-local-through-synchronization-to-vc">Global robtargets cannot be made local through Synchronization to VC</h4>
<p>Global robtargets cannot be changed to local through Synchronization to VC, the option is
disabled (PDD 3140).</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Change the robtargets to module local in the RAPID Editor and Synchronize
to station.</p>
<h4 id="error-message-sync-to-station-completed-with-errors">Error Message: Sync. to Station completed with errors</h4>
<p>Error Message: Sync to Station completed with errors: New data <em>name</em> <em>type</em> has same name as existing object in same block <em>routine</em>.</p>
<p>When this error message appears, there is a storage type mix-up between data already
stored in RS and in the VC. Because of this, and per design, the data is not considered the
same data.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure all data declarations have the same definition in RS as in RAPID (there is no user interface for this).</li>
<li>Sync to station should now work.</li>
<li>Sync back to controller, and remember to change the data declarations back to what you want.</li>

<h4 id="enforce-selected-graphics-device-for-pcs-with-multiple-graphics-cards">Enforce selected graphics device for PCs with multiple graphics cards</h4>
<p>For best performance when running RobotStudio on a PC with multiple graphics cards,
RobotStudio can be configured to use a specified device. By this option you can ensure
maximum performance. This is useful for e.g. Lenovo W540 that has both an integrated Intel
graphics device and a discrete NVIDIA card.</p>
<p>Open the file <em>RobotStudio.exe.config</em> that is located in the folders</p>
<p><em>C:\Program Files (x86)\ABB Industrial IT\Robotics IT\RobotStudio x.y\Bin64</em></p>
<p>and</p>

There are several changes in the configuration database for I/O (EIO.CFG) and Controller (SYS.CFG) that will cause System Failure if an old backup is loaded. There are also changed in installed RAPID modules. To create a compatible configuration, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create and start a VC with a RobotWare 5.13.03 system containing the same options as your original backup, but do not load the backup.</li>
<li>Save the EIO.CFG and SYS.CFG to file.</li>
<li>Compare the saved files with the corresponding files of your backup. (You can use a text file comparison tool for simplification.)</li>
<li>Add your system-specific configuration to the general configuration files saved from the 5.13.01-system using a text editor.</li>
<li>Replace the files of the original backup with the corresponding modified configuration files.</li>
<li>Go through the RAPID modules of the backup and remove the default modules (i.e. those that are not changed by the user).</li>
